# Attendance_Automation_Project
Eckovation's Final Project :
This is the project I did after I have completed my Python Programming course from Eckovation an online edutech platform.
In this project I used sqlite3 library to create a database and store the details of students by reading the a .csv file. I wrote scripts for extracting the data of a particular student for a specific time period.
